This is a simple executable. Made with PyInstaller. Testing my ability to distibute this to linux.
Meant for use with Ubuntu 18.04 or newer.


install from source directory with:
$ ./install.sh

to run:
search all applications for "hello_test"
or in a terminal from any directory run:
# hello_test

uninstall at source directory with:
$ ./uninstall.sh
